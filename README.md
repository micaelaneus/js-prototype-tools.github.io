# A collection of tools that make prototyping Javascript-based projects fast, easy, and maybe even beautiful.

## Data

### [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb)

## Design
### [Yoga Layout](https://yogalayout.com/)
The layout engine that ships with React Native. The site hosts a playground for exploring layout options that also allows you to export the styling code. 

### [CSS to JSX](https://csstox.surge.sh/)
Easily convert CSS text to React Native stylesheet objects.

### [`expo-google-fonts`](https://github.com/expo/google-fonts)
Use any of the 1000+ fonts (and their variants) from fonts.google.com in your Expo app.  

If you are trying out lots of different fonts, you can try using the `@expo-google-fonts/dev` package. You can import any font style from any Expo Google Fonts package from it. It will load the fonts over the network at runtime instead of adding the asset as a file to your project, so it may take longer for your app to get to interactivity at startup, but it is extremely convenient for playing around with any style that you want.

### [Material Design Theme Builder](https://m3.material.io/theme-builder)
Generate a dynamic color palette for M3 from an image or by using the custom color picker.

## Legal
### [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/)

## Sandbox
### [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/introduction/overview)
A cloud development platform that empowers anyone to code, collaborate, and ship projects of any size from any device in record time.

### [Codepen](https://codepen.io/)
The best place to build, test, and discover front-end code.
